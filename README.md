# Personal-Portfolio
This is a personal protfolio using HTML and CSS

## Description 

This is a porftolio meant to showcase skills learned so far in the bootcamp which include HTML and CSS. Once more skills are learned this will be changing 

Since I don't have many projects I used common website to show the projects and their links. 

## Acceptance Criteria

Here are the critical requirements necessary to develop a portfolio that satisfies a typical hiring managerâ€™s needs:

```
GIVEN I need to sample a potential employee's previous work
WHEN I load their portfolio
THEN I am presented with the developer's name, a recent photo or avatar, and links to sections about them, their work, and how to contact them
WHEN I click one of the links in the navigation
THEN the UI scrolls to the corresponding section
WHEN I click on the link to the section about their work
THEN the UI scrolls to a section with titled images of the developer's applications
WHEN I am presented with the developer's first application
THEN that application's image should be larger in size than the others
WHEN I click on the images of the applications
THEN I am taken to that deployed application
WHEN I resize the page or view the site on various screens and devices
THEN I am presented with a responsive layout that adapts to my viewport
```

## What I got from this project

I feel like theres still a lot I need to learn especially using CSS
Using flexbox was nice but confusing at the same time. I feel like I'm stll having a hard time positioning things. 

I will keep learning and improving and hopefully before the end of this course I can resubmit this assignment with my own projects and better display!
